# payday2-loadout-randomiser
This is the first project I ever finished. It takes the user's input (their current level in the game) and uses that to output a Primary, Second and Melee weapon for them to use on their next round/map in the game.

v1.0:
This is the first version of the project, using a lot of lists which I hope to remove/replace in later editions to tidy up the code and make it more efficent to read and run.

v1.1:
Added a 'while' loop to allow the user to keep running the program over and over so they can either re-run their load-out without having to re-open/re-start the program.
